just a sample repository

Hello mortals

Danny here.  Im poking around GitHub to see how useful this repository may be to me.

I am always learning, but currently I'm focused on C++, and Structured Query Language.

I just realized I am such a nerd.  But, I am okay with it.  I dont have much else to add at the moment.

Take care,
